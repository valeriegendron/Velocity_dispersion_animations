# Velocity_dispersion_animations
Animations of graphs of radial, tangential and radial (z) velocity dispersions for all time steps of galaxy collision simulations

The name of the files contain the following information:
1) The name of the run (for example 'Af_v1');
2) The type of particles used to obtain the animation: 'g' for gas particles and 's' for star particles.
